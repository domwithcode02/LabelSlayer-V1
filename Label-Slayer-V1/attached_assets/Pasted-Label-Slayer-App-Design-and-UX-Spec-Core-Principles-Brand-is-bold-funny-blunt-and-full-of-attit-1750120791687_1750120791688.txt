Label Slayer App – Design and UX Spec
Core Principles
Brand is bold, funny, blunt, and full of attitude (Leon from Curb Your Enthusiasm vibes)

App is fast, visually dynamic, and highly interactive

No stock or boring elements; everything should look and feel custom

Every piece of copy is Leon-style: direct, energetic, sometimes funny, never corporate

Overall Theme
Dark mode by default with high-contrast pops of neon (orange, green, red, yellow)

Rounded, bold cards for key content; soft glowing shadows under CTAs and major sections

Micro-animations: Nothing appears statically. Elements bounce, slide, or “slash” in

Custom mascot (Leon-inspired, not a direct copy): Reacts to user actions and appears on key screens with expressions (smug, disappointed, impressed, etc.)

Each has a mascot comment:

6. About Page
